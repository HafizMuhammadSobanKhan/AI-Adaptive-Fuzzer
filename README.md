# **AI-Adaptive-Fuzzer**  
### **AI-Enhanced Adaptive Fuzzing for Automated Vulnerability Detection**

## **Overview**
AI-Adaptive-Fuzzer is an **AI-driven fuzzing framework** that integrates **Reinforcement Learning (RL) with AFL++** to **intelligently optimize mutation strategies** for software security testing. The framework continuously adapts its fuzzing approach based on **real-time execution feedback**, improving **code coverage**, **mutation efficiency**, and **vulnerability discovery** in **embedded systems and software applications**.

This project builds upon **AFL++**, extending its capabilities with **AI-driven mutation selection and execution feedback mechanisms**. The framework has been rigorously tested on **LAVA-M (synthetic vulnerability dataset) and Zephyr RTOS (real-world embedded systems)**.

## **Key Features**
‚úÖ **AI-Guided Mutation Strategy:** Uses Reinforcement Learning to **prioritize high-impact test cases**  
‚úÖ **Adaptive Fuzzing Strategies:** Dynamically **adjusts mutation techniques** based on real-time execution feedback  
‚úÖ **Integration with AFL++:** Utilizes an **external mutator module** to interact with AFL++ without modifying its core engine  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Execution Feedback:** Collects **runtime coverage, execution performance, and crash data**  
‚úÖ **Scalability Across Embedded Architectures:** Designed for **firmware, real-time OS (RTOS) testing, and security validation**

## **System Architecture**
The AI-Adaptive-Fuzzer consists of multiple key components:

- **AFL++ Core Engine** ‚Äì Responsible for **test case execution, instrumentation, and input mutation**  
- **AI-Driven Mutation Engine** ‚Äì A Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based **decision-making module** that optimizes test case selection  
- **Execution Feedback Loop** ‚Äì Collects **runtime execution results, coverage data, and crash reports** to refine mutation strategies  
- **External Mutator Module** ‚Äì A bridge between **AFL++ and the AI decision-making system**  
- **Target Embedded Systems** ‚Äì The fuzzer is tested on **LAVA-M (synthetic vulnerabilities) and Zephyr RTOS (real-world firmware testing)**

## **Setup & Configuration**
To successfully **run and evaluate** the AI-Adaptive-Fuzzer, follow these steps:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Dependencies**
- Ensure your system has **Python 3.8+** and the necessary libraries installed.
- AFL++ should be properly installed and configured.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the Target Program**
- The target program (e.g., a **Base64 vulnerability replica from LAVA-M**) must be **compiled with AFL++ instrumentation**.
- Ensure the binary executes correctly before running the fuzzer.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Input & Output Directories**
- **Seed input files** must be provided for fuzzing.
- The **output directory** should be properly set up for storing fuzzing results.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Run AI-Enhanced Fuzzing**
- The AI-driven fuzzer should be executed with the appropriate settings to **allow reinforcement learning-based decision-making**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor Execution & Collect Results**
- The framework **logs mutation decisions, execution results, and crash reports** for evaluation.
- Performance can be analyzed using **mutation logs, code coverage data, and detected vulnerabilities**.

## **How It Works**
The **AI-Adaptive-Fuzzer** operates in a structured, iterative process:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Fuzzing Initialization:** AFL++ generates an initial set of **baseline test cases**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Execution & Monitoring:** The test cases are run on the **target firmware/software**, and execution feedback is collected.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **AI Feedback Processing:** The RL agent **analyzes execution results** and determines the most effective mutation strategy.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Mutation Application:** New test cases are generated using **AI-optimized mutation policies** and sent back to AFL++.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Continuous Learning:** The **AI model continuously refines its mutation strategy** based on fuzzing results.

## **Evaluation & Results**
The **AI-Adaptive-Fuzzer** has been tested in **real-world scenarios**:

- **LAVA-M Dataset** (Structured vulnerabilities for fuzz testing)  
- **Zephyr RTOS** (Real-time operating system for embedded systems)  

The framework is evaluated based on the following performance metrics:

- **Code Coverage Analysis** ‚Äì Measures the effectiveness of test cases in exploring the software under test.  
- **Vulnerability Detection Rate** ‚Äì Tracks how many unique vulnerabilities are discovered.  
- **Mutation Effectiveness** ‚Äì Determines how efficiently AI-driven mutations improve the fuzzing process.
